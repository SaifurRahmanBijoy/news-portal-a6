            <h3>1.Difference between var,let and const.</h3>
            <p>The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in JavaScript include:
                Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
                Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in
                their enclosing
                scope even before they are declared.
                Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to
                the immediate
                enclosing block.</p>

            <h3>2.Difference between Arrow function and Regular function.</h3>
            <p>
                In regular function, this value is dynamic, In arrow function it equals to this of the outer function.
                In regular function, arguments will give you list of parameter passed in function, In arrow function
                arguments is not
                defined.
                In regular function, you always have to return any value, but in Arrow function you can skip return
                keyword and write in
                single line.
                In arrow function parameters should be unique.
                Hoisting matters in arrow function as function get not be invoked before initialisations.</p>

            <h3>3.Why we use Template String?</h3>
            <p>Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly
                for string
                interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged template
                literal may not
                result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you want on
                the different
                parts of the template literal.
